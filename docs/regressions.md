### R-1: TEMPLATES_DIR using os.homedir() instead of module-relative path

**Introduced in:** `5cd31f2` (scaffold robustness fix)
**Fixed in:** `797f1af`

The template directory was resolved as `os.homedir() + "/.config/opencode/templates"`, which only works when the kit is cloned at `~/.config/opencode/`. On CI, other dev machines, or any clone outside the config directory, `readTemplate()` would always return `null`.

**Root cause:** The original code used a relative path (`path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "templates")`) which was incorrectly replaced with an absolute os.homedir() path.

**Fix:** Resolve relative to `import.meta.dirname` first, with os.homedir() as fallback.

**Test coverage:** `scaffold.test.ts` verifies real template content (Article I, Article II) loads from the correct path.

### R-2: isValidProjectRoot deadlock — constitution cannot bootstrap a new project

**Introduced in:** `060e469` (scaffold race condition fix)
**Fixed in:** current

`isValidProjectRoot` requires `.opencode/spec-memory/` to exist, but the only code path that creates that directory is constitution scaffolding — which also calls `isValidProjectRoot` and rejects the operation on a fresh directory.

**Root cause:** The project root validation was changed from a blacklist ("deny if inside ~/.config/opencode") to a whitelist ("must have .opencode/spec-memory/"), without exempting the bootstrap command.

**Fix:** Exempt `template: "constitution"` from the `isValidProjectRoot` check in `speckit-scaffold.ts`.

**Test coverage:** `cold-start.test.ts` (11 tests) verifies the full bootstrap sequence from an empty directory with no pre-created spec-memory.

### R-3: Test helpers must not hide production preconditions

**First identified in:** R-2 investigation

The `createTempWorktree()` helper in `tools/test/helpers/setup.ts` pre-creates `.opencode/spec-memory/`, which means no test exercises the real cold-start path. This hid the R-2 deadlock through 493 tests.

**Prevention guideline:** When adding a new test helper, verify it does not silently satisfy a precondition that production code must satisfy on its own. Add at least one test that starts from a truly empty directory without the helper.

### R-4: Approval auto-fix substring collision — message.includes instead of explicit artifact field

**Introduced in:** `babb4ac` (audit auto-fix extension to ready-violation and approval categories)
**Fixed in:** `4101e4d`

The approval auto-fix loop used `finding.message.includes("spec"/"plan"/"tasks")` to decide which approval field to flip. Since `finding.message` includes the feature directory name (e.g., `"001-tasks-view: spec.md exists but spec approval not marked generated"`), a feature named "tasks view" would cause `includes("tasks")` to match on **all** approval findings for that feature, not just the tasks one.

**Root cause:** No explicit discriminator field on the `AuditFinding` interface; the fix logic relied on substring matching against a human-readable message that contained unrelated data (the directory name).

**Fix:** Added `artifact?: "spec" | "plan" | "tasks"` to `AuditFinding`, set at creation time in `auditFeature()`, and switched the fix loop from `finding.message.includes("spec")` to `finding.artifact === "spec"`.

**Test coverage:** `audit.test.ts` (29 tests) includes a regression test that creates feature `001-tasks-view` with only `spec.md` and verifies `--fix` does not overcorrect `approvals.tasks.generated`.

### R-5: SessionState.phase typed as string vs Zod z.enum allowing silent interface-schema divergence

**Introduced in:** Initial (interface and schema were always manual copies)
**Fixed in:** `7a8ccf0`

`SessionState.phase` was typed as `string` in the interface but `z.enum([...])` in the Zod schema. A typo like `"imp"` would pass TypeScript but be rejected by `safeParse` on the next `readSession`, silently resetting the entire session to `DEFAULT_SESSION`. Additionally, `writeSession`, `writeSpecJson`, and `writeConfig` serialized directly without validation, so invalid data would persist to disk before any read-side validation caught it.

**Root cause:** Manual duplication of type definitions across interface and Zod schema; no runtime validation gate on write paths.

**Fix:** Replaced all 4 manual interfaces (`SessionState`, `SpecJson`, `SDDConfig`, `ApprovalState`) with `export type Foo = z.infer<typeof FooSchema>` so the Zod schema is the single source of truth for both compile-time types and runtime validation. Added `safeParse` gates at the start of every write function, skipping the write on validation failure.

**Test coverage:** `shared-io.test.ts` verifies that writing invalid session/spec data skips the write and preserves the existing file.

### R-6: Direct fs.writeFile risked file corruption on interruption

**Introduced in:** Initial (all write functions used `fs.writeFile` directly)
**Fixed in:** `d7f4ac1`

`writeSession`, `writeSpecJson`, and `writeConfig` all called `fs.writeFile(fp, data)` directly. If the process was interrupted during the write (power loss, crash), the file would be left truncated or corrupt with no recovery option. For session.json in particular, corruption causes `safeParse` to return `DEFAULT_SESSION`, losing the user's working state.

**Root cause:** No atomic write pattern; direct mutation of the target file.

**Fix:** Added an `atomicWriteFile(fp, data)` helper that writes to `fp + ".tmp"` first, then atomically renames `.tmp` to `fp` via `fs.rename`. If the write or rename fails, the `.tmp` file is cleaned up and the original file is untouched. All three write functions now use this helper.

**Test coverage:** `shared-io.test.ts` verifies `.tmp` cleanup, overwrite correctness, parent directory creation, and empty content handling.

### R-7: Write functions throw on validation failure instead of silent skip

**Introduced in:** `96e8932`

`writeSession`, `writeSpecJson`, and `writeConfig` previously returned `void` on validation failure, silently skipping the write. This caused caller desync: the caller assumed data was persisted but it was not. All three functions now throw on `safeParse` failure, ensuring the caller knows the write was skipped.

Additionally, `opencode.jsonc` was sanitized — `C:\Users\ignac\` personal paths replaced with `~/.config/opencode/**` — and scraping/rate-limit patterns were added to `COMPLEXITY_KEYWORDS`.

**Test pattern:** Pass invalid data to each write function (e.g., `{ phase: "bogus" }` to `writeSession`) and assert that it throws with "validation failed" in the message.

### R-8: writeConfig lock, parsePhase init guard, isErrorWithCode type guard, nullish coalescing, AuditFinding type

**Introduced in:** `5bcf5f7`

Six hardening items in one round:

- **P-HIGH-1**: `writeConfig` acquired its own `acquireLock`/`releaseLock` internally (matching `writeSession` and `writeSpecJson`), removing the dependency on the caller's `withLock`.
- **P-MED-1**: `parsePhase("init")` now explicitly returns `"spec"` instead of silently falling through the `isPhase` check.
- **P-MED-2**: Three `isENOENT`/`isEEXIST`/`isESRCH` helpers replaced `(err as Record<string, unknown>).code` with a shared `isErrorWithCode` type guard, isolating the unsafe cast inside a single narrow function.
- **P-LOW-1**: `||` → `??` in `speckit-validate.ts` line 33.
- **P-LOW-2**: `args.taskDescription` now guarded with `?? ""` in `speckit-complexity.ts`.
- **P-LOW-3**: All 37 `(f: any)` in `audit.test.ts` replaced with `(f: AuditFinding)` after exporting the interface from `speckit-audit.ts`.

**Test pattern:** Each item has a focused regression test: `parsePhase("init")` returns `"spec"`, `isErrorWithCode` rejects non-Error values, `AuditFinding` is a typed interface importable from the audit tool.

### R-9: Remove string sniffing, `||` to `??` consistency

**Introduced in:** `c1deb64`

- `specJsonMismatches` in `speckit-clean.ts` changed from `issues.filter(i => i.includes("spec.json")).length` (string sniffing) to a direct counter incremented at the source during the loop.
- `||` → `??` in `speckit-config.ts` line 67 for consistency with line 61 (`args.defaultTechStack ?? null`).
- Added `parsePhase("init")` test.

### R-10: Resilience Layer — Backups, Transactions, and Corruption Warnings

**Introduced in:** `15018a1`, `1f30c7e`, `15e90c6`, `dd8374f`

Three interconnected features forming a resilience layer for state files:

#### R-10a: `writeWithBackup` — automatic pre-write backups

All write functions (`writeSession`, `writeSpecJson`, `writeConfig`) now use `writeWithBackup` instead of direct `atomicWriteFile`. Before writing, the helper reads the existing file content and saves it as `<file>.<timestamp>.bak` in `<project>/.opencode/backups/`. Old backups are trimmed to a maximum of 10. If the file does not exist yet, no backup is created.

**Rationale:** Any bug or incorrect `--fix` that corrupts state is recoverable by restoring the most recent `.bak` file.

**Test pattern:** Write to an existing file, verify `.bak` is created with the previous content. Write 15 times in sequence, verify only 10 backups remain. First write to a new file creates no backup.

#### R-10b: Two-phase commit in `/clean --fix`

The fix operation now follows a strict collect → validate → apply pattern:

1. **Collect**: Iterate all features, read spec.json, compute the correct phase and `ready_for_implementation` flag, store pending changes in memory.
2. **Validate**: Run `SpecJsonSchema.safeParse` on every pending spec.json. If ANY fails, throw before writing anything.
3. **Apply**: Write all validated spec.json files using `writeWithBackup`.

The session.json fix follows the same pattern: collect changes as callbacks, then apply atomically under a single lock.

**Rationale:** Prevents partial repairs. Before R-10b, if `/clean --fix --fix` was interrupted mid-loop, some features were repaired and others were not.

#### R-10c: `corruptionWarnings` global warning channel

A global `CorruptionWarning[]` array accumulates warnings whenever a `read*` function detects corruption:

- `readSession`: catches `JSON.parse` errors and `safeParse` failures, pushes warning (skips ENOENT — file not found is normal).
- `readSpecJson`: same pattern.
- `readConfig` (in `speckit-config.ts`): same pattern.

The `pushCorruptionWarning` helper also writes to `console.warn` with a `[SDD]` prefix. Tools that consume warnings:
- `/audit`: emits findings with `category: "corruption"`, `severity: "warn"`.
- `/status`: appends `[CORRUPTION]` lines to output and adds `[corruption detected]` to the title.

After consumption, each tool calls `clearCorruptionWarnings()`.

**Rationale:** Previously, corrupt state files were silently replaced with defaults. Users had no indication that their session or spec.json was corrupted.

**Test pattern:** Write invalid JSON to each state file, call the corresponding `read*` function, verify the warning array has an entry. Run `/audit` with corruption present, verify a `corruption` category finding exists. Run `/status` with corruption, verify output includes `[CORRUPTION]`. Delete the state file (ENOENT case), verify no warning is emitted.

#### R-10d: Integration tests for corruption edge cases

The `corruption.test.ts` file covers:
- Corrupt session.json (invalid JSON) → warning emitted, appears in audit
- Corrupt spec.json (invalid JSON) → warning emitted
- Corrupt config.json (invalid JSON) → warning emitted
- Empty session.json (SyntaxError from `JSON.parse("")`) → warning emitted
- Empty spec.json (SyntaxError) → warning emitted
- Valid files → no warnings
- `clearCorruptionWarnings()` resets the array
- Manual `pushCorruptionWarning` adds to the array

### R-11: Filesystem-root worktree scattered SDD state to the drive root

**Introduced in:** opencode workspace behavior (worktree = `/` for sessions without a project)
**Fixed in:** current

Sessions whose tool-context `worktree` was `/` resolved every state path to the drive root on Windows: SDD state landed in `C:\.opencode` and features in `C:\specs`, outside any project. Tools also loaded `guard.json` from the wrong root.

**Root cause:** Tools trusted `context.worktree` without validation. On Windows, `path.join("/", ".opencode")` resolves to the current drive root (`C:\.opencode`), and `isValidProjectRoot` passed because that directory happened to exist.

**Fix:** `resolveProjectRoot(context)` skips filesystem roots, falls back to `context.directory` (the session directory), and errors when no valid project directory exists. Applied to all tools; both plugins resolve their root via `pickProjectRoot`.

**Test coverage:** `project-root.test.ts` (resolver unit tests) and `project-root-gate.test.ts` (tool fallback + gate bypass).
